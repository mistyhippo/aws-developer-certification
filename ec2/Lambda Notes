						Lambda Notes

	Will most likely be on the exam at this point

	What is Lambda?

	- AWS Lambda is a compute service where you can upload your code and create a Lambda function.
	- AWS Lambda takes care of provisioning and managing the servers that you use to run the code
	- You dont have to worry about operating systems, patching, scaling, etc.

	- YOu can use Lambda in the following ways:
		- As an event-driven compute service where AWS Lambda runs your code in response to events
		- These events could be changes to data in an Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon DynamoDB table
		- As a compute service to run your code in response to HTTP requests using Amazon API Gateway or API calls made using AWS SDKs



	- Data Centres
	- Hardware
	- Assembly Code/Protocols
	- High Level Languages
	- Operating Systems
	- Application Layer/ AWS APIs
	- AWS Lambda

	What languages are supported in Lambda?
	- Node.js
	- Java
	- Python
	- C#

	How is Lambbda Priced?
	- Based on Number of requests
		- First 1 millison requests are free
		- $0.20 per 1 million requests after that

	- Duration
		- Durations is calculated from the time your code begins executing until it returns or otherwise terminates,
		  rounding up to the nearest 100ms
		  - The price depends on the amount of memory you allocate to your function. You are charged $0.00001667 for
		  	every GB-second used

	Why is Lambda Cool?
	 - No Servers!
	 - Continuous Scaling
	 - Super super super cheap
