			Summary of EC2 Section

	Remember to read EC2 FAQ

	Know the differences between:
		- On Demand
		- Spot
		- Reserved
		- Dedicated Hosts


	Remember with spot instances
	- If you terminate the instance, you pay for the hour
	- If AWS terminates the spot instance, you get the hour it was terminated in for free

	Remember the EC2 Instance Types

	EBS Consists of :
		- SSD, General Purpose - GP2 - (Up to 10,000 IOPS)
		- SSD, Provisioned IOPS - IO1 - (More than 10,000 IOPs)
		- HDD, Throughput Optimized -ST1 - frequently accessed workloads
		- HDD, Cold - SC1 - less frequently accessed data
		- HDD, Magnetic - Standard - cheap, infrequently accessed storage

		You cannot mount 1 EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances
		instead use EFS


 	Termination Protection is turned off by default, you must turn it on

 	On an EBS-backed instance, the default action is for the root EBS volume to be deleted when the instance is terminated

 	Volumes vs Snapshots

 	- Volumes exists on EBS
 		- Virtual Hard Disk

 	- Snapshots exist on S3

 	You can take a snapshot of a volume, this will store that volume on S3

 	Snapshots are point in time copies of Volumes

 	Snapshots are incremental, this means that only the blocks that have changed since your last snapshot are moved to S3

 	Snapshots - Security:

 	Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically

 	Volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted automatically

 	You can share snapshots, but only if they are unencrypted

 	Snapshots of Root Device Volumes:

 	- To create a snapshot for Amazon EBS volumes that serve as root devices, you should stop the instance before taking the snapshot

 	Instance Store Volumes are sometimes called Ephemeral Storage

 	Instance store volumes cannot be stopped. If the underlying host fails you will lose your data

 	EBS backed instances can be stopped. You will not lose the data on this instance if it is stopped

 	YOu can reboot both, you will not lose data

 	By default, both ROOT volumes will be deleted on termination, however with EBS volumes, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume.

 	Amazon Machine Images
 	 - AMIs are regional
 	 - You can only launch an AMI from the region in which it is stored
 	 - You can copy AMIs to other regions using the console, command line, or the Amazon EC2 API

 	 Standard Monitoring = 5 minutes
 	 Detailed Monitoring = 1 minute

 	 CloudWatch is for performance monitoring

 	 CloudTrail is for auditing

 	 What can I do with cloudWatch?
 	 - Dashboards - Creates awesome dashboards to see what is happening with your AWS environment
 	 - Alarms - Allows you to set Alarms that notify you when particular thresholds are hit
 	 - Events - CloudWatch Events helps you to respond to state changes in your AWS resources

 	 Roles Lab

 	 - Roles are more secure than storing your access key and secret access key on individual EC2 instances
 	 - Roles are easier to manage
 	 - Roles can be assigned to an EC2 instance AFTER it has been provisioned using both the command line and the AWS console
 	 - Roles are universal, you can use them in any region

 	 Instance Meta-data
 	 - Used to get information about an instance(such as public ip)
 	 - curl http://169.253.169.254/latest/meta-data
 	 - No such thing as user-data for an instance

 	 EFS Features (Elastic File System)
 	 - Supports the Network File System version(NFSv4) protocol
 	 - You only pay for the storage you use (no pre-provisioning required)
 	 - Can scale up to the petabytes
 	 - Can support thousands of concurrent NFS connections
 	 - Data is stores across multiple AZ's within a region
 	 - Read After Write Consistency

 	 What is Lambda?
 	 - AWS Lambda is a compute service where you can upload your code and create a Lambda function
 	 - AWS Lambda takes care of provisioning and managing the servers that you use to run the code
 	 - You don't have to worry about operating systems, patching, scaling, etc.
 	 - You can use Lambda in the following ways:
 	  	- As an event-driven compute service where AWS Lambada runs your code in response to events
 	  	- These events could be changes to data in an Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon DynamoDB table
