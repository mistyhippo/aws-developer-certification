Security Groups Lab

Security Group is a Virtual Firewall

log into aws instance


Make sure httpd service starts on reboot:
chkconfig httpd on

Any changes you make to a security group applies immediately

Security Groups are stateful
	- This means as soon as you add an inbound rule, outbound rules are added automatically

You cannot deny network traffic using the inbound rules. Only allow traffic. Traffic is blocked by default

All Inbound Traffic is Blocked by Default

You can have any number of EC2 instances within a security group

You can have multiple security groups attached to EC2 Instances
	-aws will look at the multiple rules and configure them for you

	Security Groupes are STATEFUL
		- If you create an inbound rule allowing traffic in, that traffic is automatically allowed back out again

	You cannot block specific IP addresses using Security Groups, instead use Network Access Control Lists

	You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules.
