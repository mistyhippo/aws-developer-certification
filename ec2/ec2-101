EC2 101
Elastic Compute Cloud

Read the EC2 FAQ Before the Exam

What is EC?
- a web serice that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity both upd and down as your computing requirements change.

Virtual Machines in the Cloud

On Demand- allow you to pay a fixed rate by the hour with no commitment

Reserved - Provide you with a capacity reservation, and offere a significant discount on the hourly charge for an
			instance. 1 Year or 3 Year Terms.

Spot - enable you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times

Dedicated Hosts - Pysical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server bound software licenses

On Demand

- Users that want the low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 wihtout any up-front payment or long-term commitment
- Applications with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
- Applications being developed or tested on Amacon EC2 for the first time

Reserved

- Applications with steady state or predictable usage
- Applications that require reserved capacity
- Users are able to make upfront payments to reduce their total computing costs

Spot

- applications that have flexible start and end times
- prices fluctuate like the stock market
- applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices
- users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity

Dedicated Hosts
- useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualisation
- great fo rlicenseing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments
- can be purchased On-Demand(hourly)
- can be purchased as a Reservation forup to 70% off the On-Demand price

Exam Tip : Spot Prices
- If the Spot instance is terminated by Amazon EC2, you will not be charged for a partial hour of usage.
- If you terminate the instance yourself, you will be harged for any hour in which the instance ran

EC2 Instances Types (Don't need to memorize these for the associate exam)

Family 					Specialty						Use Case

D2						Dense Storage					Fileservers/Data Warehousing/Hadoop

R4						Memory Optimized				Memory Intensive Apps/DBs

M4						General Purpose					Application Servers

C4						compute Optimized				CPU Intensive Apps/DBs

G2						Graphics Intensive				Video Encoding/3D Application Streaming

I2						High Speed Storage				NoSQL DBs, Data Warehousing

F1						Field Programmable Gate Array	Hardware acceleration for your code

T2						Lowest Cost, General Purpose	Web Servers/Small DBs

P2						Graphics/General Purpose GPU	Machine Learning, Bit coin Mining

X1						Memory Optimized 				SAP HANA/Apache Spark etc


What is EBS?

- allows you to create storage volumes and attach them to Amazon EC2 instances. Once attached, you can create a file system on top of these volumes, run a database, or use them in any other way you would use a block device. Amazon EBS volumes are placed in a specific Availability Zone, where they are automatically replicated to protect you from the failure of a single component

EBS Volume Types

- General Purpose SSD (GP2)
	- General purpose, balances both price and performance
	- Ratio of 3 IOPS per GB with up to 10,000 IOPS and the ability to burst up to 3000 IOPS for extended periods of time for volumes under 1 Gb

- Provisioned IPS SSD (IO1)
	- Designed for I/O intensive applications such as large relational or NoSQL databases
	- Use if you need more than 10,000 IOPS
	- Can provision up to 20,000 IOPS

- Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1)
	- magnetic ssd storage
	- Big data
	- Data warehouses
	- Log processing
	- data written in sequence instead of spread over disks
	- cannot be a boot volume

- Cold HDD (SC1)
	- Lowest Cost Storage for infrequently accessed workloads
	- File Server
	- cannot be a boot volume

- Magnetic(Standard)
	- Lowest cost per gigabyte of all EBS volume types that is bootable
	- Magnetic volumes are ideal for workloads where data is accessed infrequently, and applications where the lowest storage cost is imporant

	EXAM TIPS EC2
	- Know the difference between:
		- On Demand
		- Spot
		- Reserved
		- Dedicated Hosts

	Remeber with spot instances:
		- If you terminate the instance you pay for the hour
		- If AWS terminates the spot instance , you get the hour it was terminated in for free

	EBS Consists of:
		- SSD, General Purpose - GP2 - (Up to 10,000 IOPS)
		- SSD, Provisioned IOPS - 101- (More than 10,000 IOPS)
		- HDD, Throughput Optimized - ST1 - frequently accessed workloads
		- HDD, Cold - SC1 - less frequently accessed data
		- HDD, Magnetic - Standard - cheap, infrequently accessed storage

		You cannot mount 1 EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances, instead use EFS
