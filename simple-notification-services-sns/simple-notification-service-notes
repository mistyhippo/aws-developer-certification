Simple Notification Service

Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and send notifications from the cloud

It provides developers with a highly scalable, flexibile, and cost-effective capability to publish messages from an application and immediately deliver them to subscribers or other applications

Amazon SNS follows the "publish-subscribe"(pub-sub) messaging paradigm, with notifications being delivered to clients using a "push" mechanism that eliminates the need to periodically check or "poll" for new information and updates.

With simple APIs requiring minimal up-front developement effort, no maintenance or management overhead and pay-as-you-go-pricing, Amazon SNS gives developers an easy mechanism to incorporate a powerful notification system with their applications.

SNS uses push mechanism
SQS uses pull mechanism

Push notifications to Apple, Google, Fire OS, and Windows devices, as well as Android devices in China with Baidu Cloud Push

Besides pushing cloud notifications directly to mobile devices, Amazon SNS can also deliver notifications by SMS text message or email, to Amazon Simple Queue Service(SQS) queues, or to any HTTP endpoint

To prevent messages from being lost, all messages published to Amazon SNS are stored redundantly across multiple availability zones

SNS allows you to group multiple recipients using topics. A topic is an "access point" for allowing recipients to dynamically subscribe for identical copies of the same notification.

One topic can support deliveries to multiple endpoint types -- for example, you can group together iOS, Android, and SMS recipients. When you publish once to a topic, SNS delivers appropriately formatted copies of your message to each subscriber.
