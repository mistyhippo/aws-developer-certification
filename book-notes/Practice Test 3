Practice Test 3

You have an Amazon S3 bucket that you use to store objects. You'd like to encrypt some of the new objects you upload to this bucket. What header do you need to use in order to request server-side-encryption when using the REST API?
	- x-amz-server-side-encryption
	- Server-side encryptions is about protecting data at rest. Server side encryption with Amazon S3-managed encytpion keys employs strong multi-factor encyrption. amazon S3 encrypts each object with a unique key. As an additional safeguard, it encrypts the key itself with a master key that it regularly rotates. Amazon S3 server side encryption uses one of the strongest block ciphers available, 2256 bit Advanced Encryptions Standard to encrypt your data.
	- Amazon S3 supports bucket policies that you can use if you require server-side encryption for all objects

At what size does AWS recommend customers to use the multi-part upload tool when uploading object to S3?
	- 100 MB

What kind of messages does SNS send to endpoints?
	- A JSON document with parameters like Message, Signature, Subject, Type

Your EC2 component receives a message from a message queue. The message will then become invisible for 30 seconds. What is the ideal API request must be called in order to ensure that the message does not become visible again.
	- DeleteMessage
	- The consumer must delete the message from the queue after receiving and processing

Which of the following are supported platforms in Elastic Beanstalk?
	- Microsoft IIS
	- Apache

Your application instance takes 60 seconds to process instructuions received in an SQS message. Assuming the SQS queue is configured with the default Visibility Timeout, what is the best way to configure your application to ensure that no other instances retreive a message that has already been processed or is currently being processed?
	- Use the ReceiveMessage API call to retrieve the message, the ChangeMessageVisiblity API call to increase the visiblity timeout, and the DeleteMessage API call to delete the message when processing completes
	- SQS has a visibility timeout which gets into effect when a message is read from the SQS queue. The default time is 30 seconds, so normally after a message is read, it would not available for 30 seconds until the message is processed
	- So you need to increase the visibility timeout to 60 seconds, then read the message and then delete it.

Your supervisor asks you to find a solution for scheduling a sequence of tasks. The sequence may take several months to complete and its very important that no tasks are processed more than once. What AWS service should you recommend?
	- SWF

A recent increase in the amount of users of an application hosted on an EC2 instance that you manage has caused the instance's OS to run out of CPU resources and crash. The crash caused several users unsaved data to be lost and your supervisor wants to know how this problem can be avoided in the future. Which of the following would you NOT recommend
	- Take frequent snapshots of the EBS volume during business hours to ensure user's data is backed up
	- If you take snapshots during business hours, the situation can become worse since I/O is required to create the snapshot. 

You are working with S3 API and receive an error message: 409 Conflict. What is the possible cause of this error?
	- You're attempting to remove a bucket without emptying the contents of the bucket first

You would like to setup a static website on S3 with the least possible effort. The URL of the website is unimportant to you. Which of the following steps are neccesary?
	- Upload an index document to your S3 bucket
	- Select the 'Make Public' Permission for your buckets objects
	- Enable static website hosting in your S3 bucket properties

In SQS what does the setting, VisibilityTimeout=0 have an effect on your message?
	- Makes the message immediately available
	- SQS has a visibility timeout which gets into effect when a message is read from the SQS queue. The default time is 30 seconds, so normally after a message is read, it would not be available for 30 seconds until the message is processed. But if you set the visibility timeout it would mean that the message would be available instantly. 

DynamoDB natively supports cross table joins
	- False
	- Use RDS instead

A benefit of multi-part upload is thatyou can upload a file as it is being created
	- True
	- Using multipart upload provides the following advantages:
		- Improved throughput
			- you can upload parts in parallel to improve throughput
		- Quick recovery from network issues
			- smaller part size minimizes the impact of restarting a failed upload due to a network error
		- Pause and resume object uploads
			- you can upload object parts over time. Once you initiate a multipart upload there is no expiry: you must explicity complete or abort
		- Begin an upload before you know the final object size
			- you can upload an object as you are creating it.

	- Look it up in instance metadata

Which of the following statements about SQS is true?
	- Messages will be delivered one or more times, and message delivery order is indeterminate.
	- SQS makes a best effort to preserver order in messages, but due to the distributed nature of the queue, we cannot guarantee that you will receive messages in the exact order you sent them. 
		- You typically place sequencing information or timestamps in your messages to that you can reorder them upon receipt. 

As per the documentation, the resources part is mandatory for the cloudformation template

A local secondary index is an index that has the same hash key as the table, but a different range  key
	- True

What is the function of a conditional write?
	- A change to a DynamoDB attribute will only be written if that attribute's value has not changed since it was read
	- With a conditional write, an operation succeeds only if the item attributes meet one or more expected conditions; otherwise it returns an error

Parts of a multi-part upload will not be completed until the "complete" request has been called which puts all the parts of the file together
	- True
	- Multipart uploading is a three step process:
		- You initiate the upload, you upload the object parts
		- after you have uploaded all the parts, you complete the multipart upload
		- Upon receiving the complete multipart upload request, Amazon S3 constructs the object from the uploaded parts, and you can then access the object just as you would any other object in your bucket
