AWS Relational Database

Security Groups
- security groups act like a firewall
- They controll access to RDS DB instance by specifying the allowed source port, protocol, and IPs

Three types of security groups can be attached with RDS DB instances:
	- DB security groups
		- used when the RDS instance is not in the VPC
	- VPC secuirty groups
		- used when the RDS instance is within the VPC
	- EC2 security groups
		- can be used with EC2 instances

	DB options groups are used to configure RDS DB engines

- Amazon RDS charges are based on instance type, running time, storage size, type and I/O requests, total backup storage size, and data in and out transfers

Amazon RDS supports six DB engine types:
- Aurora DB
- MariaDB
- Microsoft SQL
- MySQL
- Oracle
- PostgreSQL

- An endpoint is a URL to access an AWS resource

Restoring a DB from a snapshot

- A snapshot can only be restored by creating a new instance
- You cannot restore a snapshot to an existing instance
	- While restoring the snapshot to a new RDS instance, you can have a different storage volume type from the one used in the snapshot

It is possible to copy and share an Amazon RDS snapshot from one region to another share it among multiple AWS accounts

RDS best practices:

- Create an individual AWS IAM user to perform DBA taks
	- Grant the mininum privileges required to perform day to day tasks
- Before creating an RDS instance it is recommended to create a DB options group and DB parameter group

- Monitor Amazon RDS instance resources to avoid peformance bottlenecks

- It is recommended to keep some extra buffer in memory and a storage volume while choosing RDS instance tpes

- Amazon RDS provides an endpoint to connect to the RDS instance
	- The IP address beneath that endpoint may change after failover takes place
