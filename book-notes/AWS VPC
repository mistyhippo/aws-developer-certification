	AWS VPC

- A VPC's scope is limited to a single region, however, it can span across multiple Availability Zones

- Every AWS region has two or more AZs.

- When you create a VPC you need to specify an IP range for that VPC
	- This IP range is called CIDR
	- CIDR is a set of IP standards that is used to create a unique identity for a network
	- It defines a set of IPs that can be allocated to resources within a network
