 	CloudWatch

 CloudWatch acts as a repository of metrics, by collating raw data from various AWS services or applications, converting it into metrics, statistics, graphs, and facilitates certain actions based on specific dta points in metrics.

 CloudWatch Namespaces
 - are containers in which metrics for different applications are stored
 - It is a mechanism to isolate metrics of different applications from each other
 - Namespaces ensure than an applications' metrics are not accidentally mixed up with 
 	any other appliction's metrics.

 Metrics
   - set of data collected over a period of time with a specific time interval for 
   	quantitative assessment, measurement, and comparison of performance data generated
   	by a specific application or a service. 
   - CloudWatch, by default, stores metrics data at  an interval of 5 mintues
   - Metrics are region based

  Statistics
  	- are a collection of aggregated metrics data for a specified period of time
  	- Metrics data is aggregated using namespace, metric name, dimensions and several 
  	data points in a given time period

  	Alarms
  	- CloudWatch alarms help in defining a threshold value that is constantly monitored, and an action is triggered when the threshold condition is breached
  	- An alarm can have three possible states:
  		- Alarm statis displays OK when the metric is within defined threshold
  		- Alarm status displays ALARM when the metric is outside defined threshold
  		- Alarm status displays INSUFFICIENT_DATA 

  	Billing Alerts
  	- CloudWatch can also monitor the monthly billing charges for an AWS account
  	- You can set the threshold for billing
  	- Only root user can enable the billing alerts

  	CloudWatch best practices

  	- It is best practice to monitor AWS resources and hosted applications using 
  	CloudWatch.	
  		- It helps in identifying performance bottlenewcks and also helps in optimizing resource costs
  	- It is recommended that you enable billing alerts for an AWS account.
  		- It helps to monitor the monthly costs and keep a tab on them
  	- By default, CloudWatch provides basic monitoring for resources and records metrics at a 5-minute interval.
  		- It is recommended that you use detailed monitorin gfor critical resources which recors metrics at a 1-minute interval
  	- Enable custom metrics where required. 
  	- Create custom metrics for monitoring application behavior and link them to CloudWatch
  	- Enable Auto Recovery and Auto Restart Alarms for your critical EC2 instances
  		- It can automatically recover the instances from hardware related or virtualization host related issues on AWS.
  	- It is recommended that you automate monitoring tasks as much as possible
  	- Upload your critical custom logs to CloudWatch for quick statistical analysis
  	- While creating custom metrics, verify log files on your EC2 instances with 
  	  CloudWatch metrics to ensure that the right data synchronizes with CloudWatch
  	 - Enable SNS notificiations for critical metric threshold breach
  	 - AWS provides 10 alarms per month per customer for free
  	 - AWS supports a maximum of up to 5000 alarms for a customer in a region
  	 - CloudWatch does not validate actions while configuring them.
