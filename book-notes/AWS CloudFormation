	AWS CloudFormation

	What is a template?

	- AWS CloudFormation Templates describes all AWS resources and their properties in JSON or YAML format.

	- When these templates are executed, the defined AWS resources are created in their respective AWS account.

	- While creating a stack, if the template path is pointing ot the local machine, then automatically it will upload the CloudFormation template to the AWS S3 bucket in the relevant region.
		- In each region, AWS CloudFormation will create its own bucket for that.

	What is a stack?

	- A stack is created on a successful execution of a template in CloudFormation. 
		- Executing a template creates a defined set of AWS resources
		- A group of these AWS resources defined in CloudFormation is called a stack.

	- If CloudFormation is unable to create any resource, the whole stack creation fails.
		- When a CloudFormation execution fails, it rolls back all execution steps and deletes any resources created during the process.

	- At the time of creating a stack from the template, AWS CloudFormation only checks for syntax errors in the JSON/YAML notation.
		- It does not check whether the IAM user has sufficient privileges.

	- The Resources section is the only required section to successfully execute an AWS CFT (CloudFormation Template)

	- Rollbacks are there by default
