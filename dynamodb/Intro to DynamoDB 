	The Basics
	- Tables
	- Items (Thin a row of data in table)
	- Attributes(Think of a column of data in a table)

	Pricing
	 - Provisioned Throughput Capacity
	 	- Write Throughput $0.0065 per hour for every 10 units
	 	- Read Throughput $0.0065 per hour for every 50 units

	 First 25 GB stored per month is free

	 Storage costs of $0.25GB per month after that

	 A DynamoDB Write Capacity Unit can handle 1 write per second
