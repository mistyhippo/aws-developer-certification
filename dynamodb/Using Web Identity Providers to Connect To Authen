	Using Web Identity Providers to Connect To Authenticate To DynamoDB

	Web Identity Providers

	You can authenticate using Web Identity providers (such as Facebook, Google, Amazon)

	This is done using AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity API

	You will need to create a role first.

	Web Identity Providers
	1) Web Identity Token
	2) App ID of provider
	3) ARN of Role

	1) AccessKeyId,SecretAccessKey,SessionToken

	2) Expiration(time limit) (time limit by default is 1 hour)

	3) AssumeRoleID

	4) SubjectFromWebIdentity
	(the unique ID that appears in an IAM policy variable for this particular identity provider)

	Steps taken to Authenticate (Remember these)
	1) User Authenticates with ID provider (such as Facebook)
	2) They are passed a Token by their ID provider
	3) Your code calls AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity API and provides the providers token and specifies the ARN for the IAM Role
	4) App can now access Dynamodb from between 15 minutes to 1 hour (default is 1 hour)
