	DynamoDB Indexes

DynamoDB - Primary Keys

Two Types of Primary Keys Available;

Single Attribute(think unique ID)
	-  Partition Key (Has Key) composed of one attribute

Composite (think unique ID and a date range)
 	- Partition Key and Sort Key (Hash and Range)composed of two attributes

 Partition Key
 	- DynamoDB uses the partition key's value as input to an internal hash function.
 	- The output from the hash function determines the partition (this is simply the physical location in which the data is stored)

 No two items in a table can have the same partition key value!

Partition Key and Sort Key
- dynamoDB uses the partition key's value as input to an internal hash function
- The output from the hash function determines the partition(this is simply the physical location in which the data is stored)

	- Two items can have the same partition key, but they must have a different sort key.
	- All items with the same partition key are stored together, in sorted order by sort key value.

	DynamoDB- Indexes

	Local Secondary Index
		- Has the SAME Partition key, different sort key
		- Can ONLY be created when creating a table.
			- They cannot be removed or modified later

	Global Secondary Index
		- Has DIFFERENT Partition key and different sort key
		- Can be created at table creation or added LATER


	DyanamoDB Streams
	- Used to capture any kind of modification of the DyanmoDB tables
	- If a new item is added to the table, the stream captures an image of the entire item, including all of its attributes
	- If an item is updated, the stream captures the "before" and "after"image of any attributes that were modified in the item.
	- If an item is deleted from the table, the stream captures an image of the entire item before it was deleted

	DynamoDB Streams Stored for 24 hours

	You can have up to 5 local and global secondary indexes per table
