	DynamoDB Provisioned Throughput Calculations

	Exam Tip

	You will be given a scenario and asked to calculate the read or write throughput

	Provisioned Throughput
	- Unit of Read provisioned throughput
		- All reads are rounded up to increments of 4KB
	- Eventually Consistent Reads(default) consist of 2 reads per second
	- Strongly Consistent Reads consist of 1 read per second

	- Unit of Write provisioned throughput
		- All Writes are 1KB
		- All writes consist of 1 write per second

	(Size of Read rounded to nearest 4 KB chunk / 4 KB) X no of items = read throughput

	Divide by 2 if eventually consistent

	Example Question:
	 - You have an application that requires to read 10 items of 1KB per second using eventual consistency. What should you set the read throughput to?

	 - First we calculate how many read units per item we need
	 - 1KB rounded to the nearkest 4KB increment = 4
	 - 4KB/4KB = 1 read unit per item

	 - 1 x 10 read items = 10
	 - Using eventual consistency we get 10/2 =5
	 - 5 units of read throughput


	 Example Question 2:

	 You have an application that requires to read 10 items of 6KB per second using eventual consisteny. What should you set the read throughput to?

	 First we calculate how many read units per item we need
	 - 6KB rounded up to the nearest increment of 4KB is 8 KB
	 - 8KB/ 4KB = 2 read units per item

	 2 x 10 read items = 20
	 Using eventual consistency we get 20/2 = 10
	 10 units of read throughput

	 Example Question 3:

	 You have an application that requires to read 5 items of 10KB per second using eventual consistency. What should you set the read throughput to?

	 - First we calculate how many read units per item we need
	 - 10 KB rounded up to nearest increment of 4KB is 12 KB
	 - 12 KB / 4KB = 3 read units per item

	 3 X 5 read items = 15
	 - Using eventual consistency we get 15/2 = 7.5
	 8 units of read throughput

	 Example 4

	 You have an application that requires to read 5 items of 10 KB per second using strong consistency. What should you se tht read throughput to?

	 - First we calculate how many read units per item we need
	 - 10 KB rounded up to nearest increment of 4KB is 12 KB
	 - 12KB/4KB = 3 read units per item

	 3 X 5 read items = 15
	 Using strong consistency we DON'T divide by 2
	 15 units of read throughput

	 Example 5 - WRITE THROUGHPUT

	 You have an application that requires to write 5 items, with each item being 10 KB in size per second. What should you set the write throughput to?

	 - Each write unit consist of 1KB of data. You need to write 5 items per second with each item using 10 KB of data
	 - 5 X 10KB = 50 write units
	 - Write throughput of 50 units

	 Example 6 - WRITE THROUGHPUT

	 You have an application that requires to write 12 items of 100KB per item each second. What should you set the write thoughput to?

	 - Each write unit consist of 1 KB of data. You need to write 12 items per second with each item having 100KB of data

	 - 12 X 100KB = 1200 write units

	 - Write throughput of 1200 Units

	 Error Codes

	 400 HTTP Status Code - ProvisionedThroughputExceededException

	 You exceeded your maximum allowed provisioned throughput for a table or for one or more global or secondary indexes
