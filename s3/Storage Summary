	Storage Summary

Exam Tips for S3 101

- Remember that S3 is Object based i.e. allows you to upload files.

- files can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB

- There is unlimited storage

- Files are stored in Buckets

- S3 is a universal namespace, names must be unique globally. 

- https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru

- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects

- Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES(can take some time to propogate)

S3 Storage Classes/Tiers

	- S3(durable, immediately available, frequently accessed)
	- S3 - IA(durable, immediately available, infrequently accessed)
	- S3 - Reduced Redundancy Storage ( data that is easily reproducible)
	- Glacier - Archived data, where you can wait 3-5 hours before accessing

	Remember the core fundamentals of S3
		- Key (name)
		- Value (data)
		- Version ID
		- Metadata
		- Access Control Lists
		- Object based storage only (for files)
		- Not suitable to install an operating system on

	S3 - Versioning
		- Stores all versions of an object (including all writes and even if you delete an object)
		- Greate backup tool
		- Once enabled, Versioning cannot be disabled, only suspended
		- Integrates with Lifecycle rules
		- Versioning MFA Delete capability, which uses multi-factor authentication, can be used to provide an additional layer of security 
		- Cross Region Replication, requires versioning enabled on the source bucket
		- Can be used in conjunction with versioning
		- Can be applied to current versions and previous versions 
		- Following actions can now be done
			- Transition to the Standard - Infrequent Access Storage Class
				(128Kb and 30 days after the creation date)
		- Archive to the Glacier Storage Class (30 days after IA)
		- Permanently Delete Objects using lifecycle management rules

	CloudFront
		- Edge Location - This is the location where content will be cached
			- This is seperate to an AWS Region/AZ

		- Origin - This is the origin of all the files that the CND will distribute.
			- This can be either an S3 Bucket, an EC2 instance, an Elastic Load Balancer or Route53.

		- Distribution - This is the name given the CND which consists of a collection of Edge Locations

				- Web Distribution - Typically used for Websites
				- RTMP distribution - Used for Media Streaming

		- Edge locations are not just READ only, you can write to them too. (i.e. put an object on to them)

		- Objects are cached for the life of the TTL (Time To Live)

		- By default, objects are cached for 24 hours

		- Time To Live is calculated in seconds

		- You can clear cached objects, but you will be charged

		Securing your Buckets

		- By default, all newly created buckets are private including objects within those buckets.

		- You can setup access control to your buckets using
			- Bucket Policies
			- Access Control Lists

		S3 buckets can be configured to create access logs which log all requests made to the S3 bucket. 
			- This can be done to another bucket

		Encryption

		- In Transit
			SSL/TLS

		- At Rest
			-Server Side Encryption
				-S3 Managed Keys - SSE-S3
				-AWS Key Management, Managed Keys- SSE-KMS

		S3 - Gateway

		- File Gateway - For flat files, stored directly on S3

		-Volume Gateway 
			- Stored Volumes - Entire Dataset is stored on site and is asynchronously backed up to S3. 

			- Cached Volumes - Entire Dataset is stored on S3 and the most frequently accessed data is cached on site

		- Gateway Virtual Tape Library(VTL)
			- Used for backup and uses popular backup applications 

		Snowball Exam Tips

		- Snowball
		- Snowball Edge

		- Understand what Snowblal is
		- Understand what Import Export is

		- Snowball can:
			- Import to S3
			- Export from S3

		S3 Transfer Acceleration

		- You can speed up transfers to S3 using S3 transfer acceleration
			- This costs extra, and has the greatest impact on people who are in far away location

		- You can use S3 to host static websites
		- Serverless
		- Very Cheap, scales automatically
		- STATIC only, cannot host dynamic sites

		CORS
		 - Cross Origin Resource Sharing
		 - Need to enable it on the resources bucket and state the URL for the origin that will be calling the bucket

		 Misc Tips

		 - Write to S3 - HTTP 200 code for a successful write
		 - You can load files to S3 much faster by enabling multipart upload

		 - Read the S3 FAQ before taking the exam. It comes up A LOT
