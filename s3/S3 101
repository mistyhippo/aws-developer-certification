		S3 101

	S3 provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly-scalable object storage.

	Amazon S3 is easy to use, with a simple web services interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web

	S3 is a safe place to store your files.

	It is Object based storage

	The data is spread acriss multiple devices and facilities

	S3 - The Basics

	S3 is Object based i.e. allows you to upload files

	Files can be from 0 bytes to 5 TB in size

	There is unlimited storage

	Files are stored in Buckets.

	S3 is a universal namespace, that is, names must be unique globally

	understand the format of bucket names

	When you upload a file to S3 you will receive a HTTP 200 code if the upload was successful

	Data Consistency Model for S3

		- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects
		- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES(can take some time to propogate)
		- When you write a new object to S3 you will be able to immediately read it
		- If you are deleting or updating an object it can take some time for that to be consistent across the S3 bucket

		S3 is a simple key value store

		S3 is Object based.

		Objects consist of the following:
			- Key(This is simply the name of the object)
			- Value(This is simply the data and is made up of a sequence of bytes)
			- Version ID (Important for versioning)
			- Metadata (Data about the data you are storing)

		Key(This is simply the name of the object)
		Value(This is simply the data and is made up of a sequence of bytes)
		Version ID(Important for versioning)
		Metadata(Data about the data you are storing)
		Subresources
			- Access Control Lists
			- Torrent

		Built for 99.99% availability for the S3 platform

		Amazon guarantee 99.99% availability

		Amazon guarantees 99.99999% durability for S3 information
		(Remember 11 x 9s)

		Tiered Storage Available

		Lifecycle Management

		Versioning

		Encryption

		Secure your data using Access Control Lists and Bucket Policies

		Storage Tiers/Classes
		- S3-99.99% availability, 99.999999999% durability, stored redundantly
		across multiple devices in multiple facilities and is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently.
		- S3-IA (Infrequently Access) For data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Lower fee than S3, but you are charged a 
		retrieval fee.
		- Reduced Redundancy Storage - Designed to provide 99.99% durability and 99.99% availability of objects over a given year.
		- Glacier - Very cheap, but used for archival only.
			- It takes 3-5 hours to restore from Glacier

		What is Glacier?
			- Glacier is an extremely low-cost storage service for data archival.
			- Amazon Glacier stores data for as little as $0.01 per gigabyte per month, and is optimized for data that is infrequently accessed and for which retrieval times of 3 to 5 hours are suitable

		S3- Charges
			- Charged for:
				- Storage
				- # of Requests
				- Storage Management pricing
				- Data Transfer Pricing
				- Transfer Acceleration

		What is S3 Transfer Acceleration?
			- Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your end users and an S3 bucket

		Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations

		As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.

	S3 Exam Tips for S3 101

	- Rememeber that S3 is Object based i.e. allows you to upload files
	- Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB.
	- There is unlimited storage
	- Files are stored in Buckets
	- S3 is a universal namespace, that is, names must be unique globally.
	- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects
	- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate)

	Storage Classes/Tiers
		- S3 (durable, immediately available, frequently accessed)
		- S3 - IA (durable, immediately available, infrequently accessed)
		- S3 - Reduced Redudancy Storage(data that is easily reproducible)


		Remember the core fundamentals of an S3 object:
			- Key(name)
			- Value(data)
			- Version ID
			- Metadata
			- Subresources
			- ACL
				-Torrent

		Object based storage only (for files)

		Not suitable to install an operating system on

		Successful uploads will generate a HTTP 200 status code
