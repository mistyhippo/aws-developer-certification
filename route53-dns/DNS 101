		DNS 101

		What is DNS?

		DNS is used to convert human friendly doman names into an Internet Protocol(IP) address.

		IP addresses are used by computers to identify each other on the newtork. IP addresses commonly come in 2 different forms, IPV4 and IPV6

		IPv4 is a 32 bit field and has over 4 billion different addresses
		IPv6 was created to solve this depletion issue and has an address space of 128 bits

		Top Level Domains
		- The last work in a domain name represents the top level domain. 
		- The second word in a domain name is the second level domain name

		Top level domain names are controlled by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority(IANA) in a root zone database which is essentially a database of all available top level domains

		Domain Registrars
		- Registrar is an authority that can assign domain names directly under one or more top-level domains.
		- These domains are registered with InterNIC, a service of ICANN, which enforces uniqueness of domain names 
		across the Internet
		- Each domain name becomes registered in a central database known as the WhoIS database.

		TTL
		- The length that a DNS record is cached on either the Resolving Server or the users own local PC is equal to the value of the "Time To Live"(TTL) in seconds. 
		- The lower the time to live, the faster changes to DNS records take to propagate throughout the internet
		- By default most TTLs are set for two days.

		CNAMES
		- can be used to resolve one domain name to another

		Alias Records
			- are used to map resource record sets in  your hosted zone to Elastic Load Balances, CloudFront distributions, or S3 buckets that are configured as websites.

			Alias records work like a CNAME record in that you can map one DNS name to another 'target' DNS name

			Key difference - A CNAME can't be used for naked domain names (zone apex). You can't have a CNAME for http://acloud.guru, it must be either an A record or an Alias

			Alias resource record sets can save you time because Amazon Route 53 automatically recognizes changes in the record sets that the alias resource record set refers to.

			EXAM TIPS:

			- Elastic Load Balancers do not have pre-defined IPv4 addresses, you resolve to them using a DNS name.
			- Understand the difference between an Alias Record and a CNAME
			- Given the choice, always choose an Alias Record over a CNAME
