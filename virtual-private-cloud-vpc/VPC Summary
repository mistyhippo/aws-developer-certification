		VPC Summary

	Be able to build out your own VPC from memory including public and private subnets including NAT instances and Bastion hosts 

	Basic Exam Tips

	- Think of a VPC as a logical datacenter in AWS 

	VPCs can span multiple availability zones 
	VPCs cannot span multiple regions

	VPCs consist of IGWs(or Virtual Private Gateways) Route Tables, Network Access Control Lists, Subnets, Security Groups

	1 subnet = 1 availability zone

	Security Groups are Stateful, Network Access Control Lists are Stateless
	
	Can Peer VPC both in the same account and with other AWS accounts 

	No such thing as Transitive peering

	Exam Tips - NAT instances
	- When creating a NAT instance, Disable Source/Destination Check on the Instance
	- NAT instance must be in a public subnet
	- Must have an elastic IP address to work
	- There must be a route out of the private subnet to the NAT instance, in order for this work
	- The amount of traffic that NAT instances supports, depend on the instance size
	- If you are bottlenecking, increase the instance size
	- You can create high availability using Autoscaling Groups, multiple subnets in different AZ's and a script to automate failover. 
	- NAT instances are always behind a security group

	Exam Tips- NAT Gateways
	 - preferred by the enterprise
	 - scale automatically up to 10Gbps
	 - no need to patch
	 - not associated with security groups
	 - automatically assigned a public ip address
	 - remember to update your route tables
	 - no need to disable source/destination checks

	 Exam Tips - Network ACLs
	 	- Your VPC automatically comes with a default network ACL and by default it allows all outbound and inbound traffic
	 	- You can create a custom network ACL.
	 		- By default, each custom network ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules
	 	- Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a netowrk ACL.
	 		- If you don't explicitly associate a sunet with a network ACL, the subnet is automatically associated with the default network ACL
	 	- You can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets
	 		- A subnet can be associated with only one network ACL at at time
	 		- When you associate a network ACL with a subnet, the previous association is removed
	 	- A network ACL contains a numbered list of rules that is evaluated in orders, starting with the lowest numbered rule.
	 	- A network ACL has separate inbound and outbound rules, and each rule can either allow or deny traffic. 
	 	- Network ACLs are stateless: responses to allowed inbound traffic are subject to the rules for outbound traffic (and vice versa)

	 	Exam Tips - Network ACLs
	 		- Block IP addresses using network ACLs not Security Groups
	 		- no option to deny traffic in a security group

	 	Exam Tips - NAT vs Bastions
	 		- A NAT is used to provide internet traffic to EC2 instances in private subnets
	 		- A Bastion is used to securely administer EC2 instances(using SSH or RDP)in private subnets

	 	Exam Tips - Resiliant Architecture
	 		- If you want resiliency, always have 2 public subnets and 2 private subnets. 
	 		- Make sure each subnet is in different availability zone
	 		- With ELBs make sure they are in 2 public subnets in 2 different availability zones 
	 		- With Bastion hosts, put the behind an autoscaling group with a minimum size of 2. 
	 			- Use Route53(either round robin or using a health check)to automatically fail over.
	 		NAT instances are tricky to make relient. You need 1 in each public subnet, each with their own public IP address, and you need to write a script to fail between the two.
	 			- Instead where possible , use NAT gateways
