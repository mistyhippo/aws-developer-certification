		VPC Overview

	Think of a VPC as a logical datacenter

	VPC don't span regions but they do span availability zones

	VPC - AWS Definition
		- Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) lets you provision a logically isolated section of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual netowrking environment, including selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. 

		- You can easily customize the network configuration for your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud. 
			- For example, you can create a public-facing subnet for your webservers that has access to the Internet, and place your backend systems such as databases or application servers in a private-facing subnet with no Internet access.
			- You can leverage multiple layers of security, including security groups and network access control lists. to help control access to Amazon EC2 instances in each subnet

			- Additionally, you can create a Hardware Virtual Private Network(VPN) connection between your corporate datacenter and your VPC and leverage the AWS cloud as an extension of your corporate datacenter.


			The internet can access our public subnets but not our private subnets

			ACLs can span subnets

			1 subnet = 1 availability zone 

			You cannot span subnets across availability zones. 

	What can you do with a VPC?

	- Launch instances into a subnet of your choosing
	- Assign custom IP address ranges in each subnet
	- Configure route tables between subnets
	- Create internet gateway and attach it to our VPC
	- Much better security control over your AWS resources
	- Instance security groups 
	- Subnet network access control lists (ACLS)

	1 internet gateway can only be attached to 1 VPC

	Default VPC vs Custom VPC

	- Default VPC is user friendly, allowing you to immediately deploy instances
	- All Subnets in default VPC have a route out to the internet
	- There is no private subnet inside a default VPC
	- If you delete the default VPC the only way to get it back is to contact AWS

	VPC Peering
	- Allows you to connect one VPC with another via a direct network route using private IP addresses 
	- Instances behave as if they were on the same private network 
	- You can peer VPC's with other AWS accounts as well as with other VPCs in the same account
	- Peering is in a star configuration, ie 1 central VPC peers with 4 others. 
		- NO TRANSITIVE PEERING!!!!

	VPC Transitive Peering 
		- You cannot talk to one VPC via another VPC

	Exam Tips:
		- Think of a VPC as a logical datacenter in AWS
		- Consists of IGWs(or Virtual Private Gateways),Route Tables, 
			Network Access Control Lists, Subnets, Security Groups

		- 1 subnet = 1 availability zone

		you cannot span subnets across multiple availability zones

		Security Groups are Stateful, Network Access Control Lists are Stateless

		You can peer VPCs with each other directly. NO TRANSITIVE PEERING
